# windelicato.com

here lies the code for my personal website. the source lives in `master` and the compiled site lives in `gh-pages`

## building
requires `npm` and `bower`
```
git clone git@github.com:windelicato/homepage
cd homepage
npm install
bower install
```

and then run `grunt` and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`
